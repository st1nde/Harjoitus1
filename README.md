This was a school project. Aim was to create a messeage app in backEnd C#. It is using Microsoft SQL server management as a database to store users and messages. 
When running this program it will open swagger. THere you can see all the avalible commands that you can use. 
Start by creating your user and setting a password for it. Use  https://www.base64encode.org/ to encode your username and password. 
Now you have your user and can start posting messages. You can edit your posted messages and delete them.
Messages can be sent to a specific recipient or just generaly to everyone.
